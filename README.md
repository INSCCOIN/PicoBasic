- I've removed a bunch of non-working apps, guess windows MMbasic isnt the same as Pico MMBasic. I'll continue trying to develop for the PicoCalc now that i've received my replacement screens.

- Please see Worklist.md for more information on programs currently being worked on.

## Requirements
- PicoCalc or compatible device
- All apps should work on all variants of the Pico, some apps may require either 1W / 2W boards, please read the comments per file.
- MMBasic firmware 6.0002

## Other
- Please credit me if you make any changes or re-releases of these applications.
