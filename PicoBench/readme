## Features

- **25 Different Math Modes:**  
  Test everything from trigonometric functions to sorting, matrix multiplication, prime testing, and more.
- **Progress Bar:**  
  See a visual indication of progress during each benchmark run.
- **Info Menu:**  
  View detailed descriptions of each math mode and what it tests.
- **Simple Menu System:**  
  Easy to use, with options to run benchmarks, view info, or exit.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Program:**  
   Load and run PicoBench4.0.bas on your MMBasic-compatible device.

2. **Main Menu Options:**  
   - **1. Run Benchmark:**  
     Select a math mode (1-25) and the benchmark will run, showing progress and timing.
     Note: These tests take anywhere from 5 minutes to over 60 minutes to complete. Please plug your device in if you decided to run.
   - **2. Info: Math Modes:**  
     View detailed explanations of each math mode.
   - **3. Exit:**  
     Quit the program.

3. **During Benchmark:**
