# PicoBench 2.61 - CPU Stress Test

## Overview
PicoBench is a CPU stress test written for the Picomite platform using PicoBasic. It is designed to push the CPU using a variety of mathematical operations and log the system temperature over a user-defined period.

## Math Modes
The program offers four different math modes, each stressing the CPU with different types of calculations:

1. **Trigonometric**: Uses SIN, COS, and LOG functions.
2. **Exponential**: Uses EXP, LOG, and exponentiation (^).
3. **Square Root & Power**: Uses SQR and exponentiation (^).
4. **Mixed/Heavy**: Combines SIN, COS, TAN, EXP, LOG, SQR, and ATN for maximum load.

## How It Works
- The user selects a math mode and test duration (in seconds).
- The program runs intensive calculations in a loop for the specified time.
- On each outer loop, it logs the system temperature (from `PIN(TEMP)`).
- At the end, it reports the maximum, median, and average temperature, as well as the total time and a summary result.

## Estimated Results
- **Trigonometric/Exponential modes**: Expect moderate CPU load and a steady temperature rise.
- **Square Root & Power mode**: Slightly less intensive, but still a good stress test.
- **Mixed/Heavy mode**: This will generate the highest CPU load and the fastest temperature increase.

Typical results on a standard Picomite setup:
- **Temperature**: May rise by 2–11°C above idle, depending on cooling and ambient conditions.
- **Result**: The final calculation result is not important for benchmarking, but is shown for completeness.
- **Final Result Range (Pico 1)**: For a well-performing Pico, the final result after a 60-second run in Mixed/Heavy mode is typically in the range of **3,000,000 to 3,500,000**.

## Notes
- CPU speed is not measured directly in this version (set to 0 in logs).
- For best results, ensure your Picomite is in a stable environment and not throttling due to overheating.
