## WIP ##

# PicoBase
  - 2 modular versions for this program, 1 requiring the 2w and one not. Both are defined in comments & the file name.
  - PicoBase is a program designed to be used on the go, PicoBaseD is designed to be used on a desktop.
  - PicoBase allows users to create, edit, delete and view .db & .csv files on the go. I'm planning for wireless database hosting for this version.
  - PicoBaseD does the same thing as PicoBase but without the wireless abilities. 
  - Estimated relase is end of summer 25


# PicoPub
  - PicoPub is a program that allows users to read .txt book formats.
  - PicoPub is to be installed in its own directory, any books you place in the root directory of PicoPub will be accessable.
  - PicoPub will NOT work with .epub or .pdf files, you will have to convert them to a .txt file on your computer then import them to the PicoCalc.
  - Early development
  - Estimated release is end of summer 25


# PicoSynth 
  - Requires Aux / Speakers
  - An interface that allows the user to ouput waveforms
  - Works best with an audio interface ie. Reaper / Bias FX 2 
  - Estimated release is end of summer 25


 # PicoHost
  - Allows the user to host a "local" HTML server.
  - Supports HTML scripts
  - Waiting for MMBasic to be updated to support full wireless
  - Requires Pico 1w/2w


# PicoSDT 
  - On board "Simple" commands for flash executions
  - Wiping flash
  - Speed test on both SD & Flash
  - Estimated release is end of summer


# Onoso I - The Great War
  - 2nd in series from Onoso Astrox
  - Onoso Astrox was orignally created for the Astrox OS but since the project was made closed source its no longer associated with the OS.
  - Currently writing for the Pico 2, will make a relase for the Pico 1 when complete. Pico 1's limitations are ram related.
  - Estimated release is end July 25
